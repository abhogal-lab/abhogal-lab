👋 Hi, I’m Alex Bhogal! I'm an assistant professor in the High Field lab at the University Medical Center in Utrecht. 

👀 I’m interested in vascular physiology and hemodynamics visualized using advanced MRI techniques combined with physiological stimuli. Also, i've grown a passion for metabolic imaging based in spectroscopy. My long term vision is to combine these incredible techniques to seach for a more complete picture of cerebral metabolism. And, as an ex-bike racer, I also love cycling and anything related to blinged out carbon road bikes.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to improve my matlab scripts, apply advanced analysis techniques to explore cerebrovascular reactivity and use machine learning to combine vascular and metabolic information for a deeper insight into (patho)physiology.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to vascular reactivity, temporal aspects of the hemodynamic response in health and disease and the combination of multi-parametric data for tissue classification. I'm sharing my tools in the hopes that they can provide a useful starting point for others developping the same interests as myself!
